<h2 id="Youth">Youth</h2>

<p>
  The youth are our future.  Their energy and passion will allow the Georgia Republican Party to build upon
  the successes that we have achieved across the state.  Last year's election season, I brought about a new level
  of youth particpation across Georgia's Twelth Congressional District and will bring these experiences to the
  State Executive Committee.  We need to address age gaps by increasingly bringing in new youth participation,
  and I have the dedication and proven history to achieve this goal.

<h2 id="Technology">Technology</h2>

<p>
  Technology was a proven decider in last year's elections across the country.  As a software engineer, I develop
  emergency management software that is used around the world to save lives when seconds count.  I will bring my
  professional expertise to the Georgia GOP to win elections when votes count.  Embracing technology and new media
  will ensure our future success as a party.  By using social media to empower our grassroots activists with up to
  the minute information, to gain greater awareness of our elections and activities.

<h2 id="Principles">Principles</h2>

<p>
  Our principles are our foundation.  Without principles, then what is the Republican party?  Along with
  my qualifications I bring my unwaivering adherence to the principles of what this party is founded on:
  limited governemnt, individual responsibility, and fiscal conservatism.
